## What we did last week

- Make migrations run on deploy
- Related links not included in translation status logic
- Design table sort (cancelling a selected sort)
- Stale translations exports should be marked as such
- Address clock change from GMT to BST which affects publishing [Dupe, won't fix]
- Change link on translation export should go straight to change name for dimensions
- errors.fact_table_validation.unknown_error
- Data table validation error
- Plan consumer recruitment for end-to-end mvp beta testing
- Gather user scenarios for using pivot tables and hierarchies
- Page not found on WRAx0101 dimensions
- Measure look up preview is different than expected
- Fix StatsCymru logo and favicon
- Remove a published dataset
- Determine whether we need to retain existing cube ID format, and how and when we will generate cube IDs

## What we're planning to do this week

- Prepare bi-lingual consumer screener and email
- Prepare and submit info for GEL QA (publisher side)
- Summarise outputs for the implementation of hybrid pivot tables and hierarchies.
- Write tests for existing code to improve test coverage
- Give devs access to to prod / prepod envs
- Create a prod / preprod environment
- Analyse feedback from first onboarding cohort
- Session properties are not namespaced so apply across all datasets
- Configure a suitable testing suite for e2e tests

## Risk and Issues

Current table showing project Risks and Issues:

!["A Trello-style digital board with three columns labeled 'Large risks (> 500)', 'Medium risks Impact score (201â€“500)', and 'Small Risks (<= 200)'. Each column contains several cards representing different risk items. The background image features a calm lake surrounded by autumn trees with vivid orange, red, and yellow foliage reflected in the water."](riskRegister20250422.png)
