# Sprint 29 Mid - Donkey

![Illustration by Ernest Howard Shepard from Winnie-the-Pooh (1926), by A A Milne  A black-and-white illustration of Eeyore, the sad-looking donkey, and Winnie the Pooh, the bear. Eeyore is slouching with his head lowered and ears drooping, while Pooh stands upright with his arms behind his back, leaning slightly forward as if speaking gently to Eeyore. The simple, expressive style conveys a moment of quiet compassion between the two well-known characters from A.A. Milneâ€™s Winnie-the-Pooh stories.](donkey2.png)

![A line graph titled "Overall risk impact score - Stats Wales 3" shows changes in total impact scores over time. The x-axis represents dates from March 2024 to May 2025, while the y-axis represents the total impact score ranging from 0 to 25,000. A purple line with crosses at each data point represents the "Impact Score." The graph shows fluctuations, with peaks around July 2024 and dips around January 2025. A legend in the upper right corner identifies the purple line as the "Impact Score."](risKImpact20250415.png)
