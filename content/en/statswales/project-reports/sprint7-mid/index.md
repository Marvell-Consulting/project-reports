The following things are still blocking us, although progress is being made:
- Access to the data -  **We now have access to the data**
- Agreement on access for Marvell subcontractors **Register Dynamics are going the process of being audited for Cyber Essentials Plus**
- Architecture form - **this has been discussed and issues that were raised are being addressed, we still do not yet have access to the subscriptions that we need**
