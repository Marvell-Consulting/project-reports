## Things to bear in mind / What's blocking us
The following things are still blocking the progress of the project

* Agreement on access for Marvell subcontractors - ***Our subcontractors are in the process of getting the required certification***
* Architecture form - Azure subscriptions - ***We are still responding to comments on the service design documents, we do not currently have access, we are unsure if this is a dependency for access***
