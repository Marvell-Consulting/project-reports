Things to bear in mind / What's blocking us
-------------------------------------------

The following things are still blocking the progress of the project

- Access to the source data
  ***Data sharing agreement is shared and back with the Welsh Gov to finally provide us with the data***

- Agreement on access for Marvell subcontractors (Cyber Essentials Plus)
  ***This is no longer a blocker, our subcontractrs have the relevant certification***

- Azure subscriptions
  ***Marvell working to establish pipelines in Azure in order to begin migration of the service into the WG estate.***
