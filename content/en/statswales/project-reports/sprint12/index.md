Things to bear in mind / What's blocking us
-------------------------------------------

The following things are still blocking the progress of the project

- Access to the source data
  ***Looking to sign the data access agreement today and then look forward to getting a useable cut of the data soon after this***

- Agreement on access for Marvell subcontractors (Cyber Essentials Plus)
  ***This is no longer a blocker, our subcontractrs have the relevant certification***

- Azure subscriptions
  ***Marvell working to establish pipelines in Azure in order to begin migration of the service into the WG estate.***
