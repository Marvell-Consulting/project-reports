Things to bear in mind / What's blocking us
-------------------------------------------

The following things are still blocking the progress of the project

- Access to the source data
  ***We now have access to the data on a machine which is available to the team. Ultimately we will still need download access to the data***

- Agreement on access for Marvell subcontractors (Cyber Essentials Plus)
  ***certification is expected by the end of the week - the audit is booked***

- Azure subscriptions
  ***Azure is still TBC - our SDD was updated to reflect a few more questions***
