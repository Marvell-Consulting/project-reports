## Things to bear in mind / What's blocking us

The following things are still blocking the progress of the project

- Access to the source data

 ***We are exploring another approach to getting a copy of the data for which we
 hope to get approval today***
- Agreement on access for Marvell subcontractors

***Our subcontractors are in the process of getting the required certification***
- Architecture form - Azure subscriptions

***We are still responding to comments on the service design documents, we do not
 currently have access***
