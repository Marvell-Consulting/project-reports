What we did last week
---------------------

- Add cleansing scripts and documentation to code repository
- Add quality analysis queries to code repository
- Assess record improvement of MHRA data using GUDID
- Draft and send out data consumers survey
- Ideation of data collection models
- Investigate quality issues with field validations in the MHRA
    dataset
- Investigate tech in Trust-hosted PIMS, such as Atrify, Elcom, GHX.
- Load MHRA DORS data into Design System-based prototype
- Map out possible to be user journey/service maps for data
    maintenance options
- Merge GUDID and MHRA data into a single SQLite db
- Recruit participants for Sprint 4 prototype testing
- Test coded prototype with data consumers \[Round 3\]

What we're planning to do this week
-----------------------------------

- Consider guidance needs
- Content iterations of prototype
- CSV/XLS export
- Decide approach for data engineering pipeline
- Design a data model for representing data provenance
- Design iterations for next round of testing (data consumers)
- Explore design approaches to data maintenance
- Identify best approach to API provision
- Investigate deduplicating products
- Output - outlining manufacture incentives
- Plan manufacturer workshop for Sprint 4
- Research outputs to date
- Technical architecture recommendations
- Understand GMDN license agreement

Goals

These are are currently identified risks and issues
---------------------------------------------------

- \[Issue\] Different people building different overlapping systems
- \[Issue\] Some comms teams won't distribute calls for researchers in
    pre-election period.
- \[Issue\] What constitutes a medical device? How can we decide what
    is included and excluded from PIM
- \[Risk\] Access to data
- \[Risk\] Consumer perception
- \[Risk\] Differing Visions of what' we're doing (Beta, proof of
    concept)
- \[Risk\] Final ownership
- \[Risk\] Lack of Engagement from manufacturers in a maintenance
    process
- \[Risk\] NHS trust infrastructure to be able to consume data from
    PIM
- \[Risk\] User availability
