These are are currently identified risks and issues
---------------------------------------------------

- [Risk] Access to data
- [Risk] Differing Visions of what' we're doing (Beta, proof of concept)
- [Issue] Different people building different overlapping systems
- [Risk]NHS trust infrastructure to be able to consume data from PIM
- [Issue] What constitutes a medical device? How can we decide what is included
and excluded from PIM

- [Risk] Lack of Engagement from manufacturers in a maintenance process
- [Issue] Some comms teams won't distribute calls for researchers in
pre-election period.

- [Risk] Quality of Data - beyond our control
- [Risk]User availability
- [Risk]Final ownership
- [Risk] Consumer perception
