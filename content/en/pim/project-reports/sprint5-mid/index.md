These are our currently identified risks and issues
---------------------------------------------------

- [Risk]User availability
- [Risk]NHS trust infrastructure to be able to consume data from PIM
- [Risk] Lack of Engagement from manufacturers in a maintenance process
- [Risk] Consumer perception
- [Risk]Final ownership
- [Issue] Different people building different overlapping systems
- [Risk] Access to data
- [Issue] What constitutes a medical device? How can we decide what is included and excluded from PIM
- [Risk] Quality of Data - beyond our control
