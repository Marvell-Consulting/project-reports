## What we did last week
- Add pagination to the dynamic prototype
- Build skeleton of dynamic prototype
- Define research plan for User Research in sprint 2
- Deploy dynamic prototype to external service
- Document and appraise the GS1 data fields
- Propose design ideas for maintenance of data
- Recommend iterations for prototypes based on research outputs
- Research - investigate what information trusts are asking manufacturers for
- Switch dynamic prototype to MHRA data
- Updates to data flows from user research so far

## What weâ€™re planning to do this week
- Content: Explore how the service could be maintained and improved in the future
- Document attempts to match MHRA data directly with GUDID
- Group analysis for round 2 - data providers
- Investigate quality issues with field validations in the MHRA dataset
- Investigate tech in Trust-hosted PIMS, such as Atrify, Elcom, GHX.
- Iterate prototypes - search

## Goals
- Get the dynamic search and view dynamic prototype ready <span class="badge bg-info">_**In progress**_</span>
- Given current knowledge about ALPHA assumption - agree clarity on ROADMAP <span class="badge bg-info">_**In progress**_</span>
- Widen our participant pool <span class="badge bg-info">_**In progress**_</span>

## Things to bear in mind
- A four-week extension to the project has been agreed

## These are are currently identified risks and issues
- [Issue] Different people building different overlapping systems
- [Risk] Differing opinions around what a PIM should be
- [Risk]Final ownership
- [Risk] Getting service assessment booked
- [Risk] Lack of Engagement from manufacturers in a maintenance process
- [Risk]NHS trust infrastructure to be able to consume data from PIM
- [Risk] PIM is an infrastructure that underpins multiple services - how do we frame what PIM is. What does "End-to-end" mean is this situation.
- [Risk] Quality of Data - beyond our control
- [Risk]User availability
- [Risk] What constitutes a medical device? How can we decide what is included and excluded from PIM
