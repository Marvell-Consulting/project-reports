* Document attempts to match MHRA data directly with GUDID
* Document the MHRA data schema
* Group analysis session for round 1 data consumers
* Investigate quality issues with field validations in the MHRA dataset
* Investigate tech in Trust-hosted PIMS, such as Atrify, Elcom, GHX.
* MHRA/DHSC Tech appraisal
* Stakeholder interviews (data providers)

## Goals
We have one goal for this sprint (two-week period)
* Find out how people feel in NHS trusts about proposed view of 13 fields <span class="badge bg-info">_**In progress**_</span>

## Things to bear in mind
* We are currently discussion a change to the programme of activities through through the next two sprints with the service owner

## These are are currently identified risks and issues
* \[Issue\] Different people building different overlapping systems
* \[Risk\] 13 fields may not be enough to provide value and / or solve the whole problem.
* \[Risk\] Engagement with manufacturers in a maintenance process
* \[Risk\] Final ownership
* \[Risk\] Getting service assessment booked
* \[Risk\] NHS trust infrastructure to be able to consume data from PIM
* \[Risk\] PIM is an infrastructure that underpins multiple services - how do we frame what PIM is. What does "End-to-end" mean is this situation.
* \[Risk\] Quality of MHRA is patchy - and is a dependency beyond our control
* \[Risk\] User availability
* \[Risk\] What constitutes a medical device? How can we decide what is included and excluded form PIM
