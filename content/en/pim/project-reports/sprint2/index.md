- Content: Explore how the service could be maintained and improved in the future
- Define research plan for User Research in sprint 2
- Document attempts to match MHRA data directly with GUDID
- Document the MHRA data schema
- Investigate quality issues with field validations in the MHRA dataset
- Investigate tech in Trust-hosted PIMS, such as Atrify, Elcom, GHX.
- Iterate prototypes - search
- Recommend iterations for prototypes based on research outputs
- Research - investigate what information trusts are asking manufacturers for

## Goals
We have these goals this sprint (two-week period):
- Given current knowledge about ALPHA assumption - agree clarity on ROADMAP <span class="badge bg-info">_**In progress**_</span>
- Widen our participant pool <span class="badge bg-info">_**In progress**_</span>

## Things to bear in mind
- We are currently discussing changes to the roadmap and possibly the lenght of the project in light of things that we've discovered through explorations of data and user research

## These are are currently identified risks and issues
- /[Issue/] 13 fields may not be enough to provide value and / or solve the whole problem.
- /[Issue/] Different people building different overlapping systems
- /[Risk/]Final ownership
- /[Risk/] Getting service assessment booked
- /[Risk/] Lack of Engagement from manufacturers in a maintenance process
- /[Risk/] NHS trust infrastructure to be able to consume data from PIM
- /[Risk/] PIM is an infrastructure that underpins multiple services - how do we frame what PIM is. What does "End-to-end" mean is this situation.
- /[Risk/] Quality of Data - beyond our control
- /[Risk/]User availability
- /[Risk/] What constitutes a medical device? How can we decide what is included and excluded from PIM
