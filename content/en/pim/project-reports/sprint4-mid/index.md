What we did last week
---------------------
- Investigate quality issues with field validations in the MHRA dataset
- Assess record improvement of MHRA data using GUDID
- Investigate tech in Trust-hosted PIMS, such as Atrify, Elcom, GHX.
- Map out possible to be user journey/service maps for data maintenance options
- Recruit participants for Sprint 4 prototype testing
- Draft and send out data consumers survey
- Merge GUDID and MHRA data into a single SQLite db
- Add cleansing scripts and documentation to code repository
- Add quality analysis queries to code repository
- Load MHRA DORS data into Design System-based prototype
- Test coded prototype with data consumers [Round 3]
- Ideation of data collection models
- Implement 'Name the dataset' - working software
- Implement 'Choose a dataset to upload' - working software

What we're planning to do this week
-----------------------------------
- Explore design approaches to data maintenance
- Plan manufacturer workshop for Sprint 4
- Import full GMDN data (including hierarchies!)
- Get RC service map and data flows from MHRA
- Sorting of search results in the prototype, especially by manufacturer 
- Appraise NHS Supply Chain
- Decide approach for data engineering pipeline
- Research outputs to date
- Plan manufacturer workshop for Sprint 5
- Graphic for data collection workflows to show manufacturers
- Investigate deduplicating products
- Analyse data consumer survey responses
- Identify best approach to API provision
- Authz requirements for PIM users
- Identity - identify users to PIM, can we re-use existing MHRA structures to
 allow NHS and manufacturing users to log in? 
- Design iterations for next round of testing (data consumers)

Goals
-----
- First prototype for data maintenance.

These are are currently identified risks and issues
---------------------------------------------------
- [Risk] Access to data
- [Risk] Differing Visions of what' we're doing (Beta, proof of concept)
- [Issue] Different people building different overlapping systems
- [Risk] NHS trust infrastructure to be able to consume data from PIM
- [Issue] What constitutes a medical device? How can we decide what is included and excluded from PIM
- [Risk] Lack of Engagement from manufacturers in a maintenance process
- [Issue] Some comms teams won't distribute calls for researchers in pre-election period.
- [Risk] Quality of Data - beyond our control
- [Risk] User availability
- [Risk] Final ownership
- [Risk] Consumer perception
